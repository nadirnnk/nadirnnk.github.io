    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, Iâ€™m <strong>Nadir Najeeb Kassim</strong> ðŸ‘‹<br>
      Welcome to my personal website! I'm a Machine Learning Engineer with a passion for exploring different deep learning methods. I enjoy building intelligent systems, exploring new technologies, and turning complex ideas into practical solutions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Iâ€™m currently pursuing my Masterâ€™s in AI at Nanyang Technological University. Previously, I worked at the Neuronics Lab at the Indian Institute of Science, and I completed my Bachelor's in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from VIT.
    </p>
    <p>
      Take a look at my projects, explore my interests, or connect with me â€” Iâ€™m always open to collaboration and learning.

        <h3>Revamping MobileNet-V3 for Facial Segmentation</h3>
        <p>
          To evaluate MobileNetV3-Large for high-fidelity facial segmentation under a strict 3 M-parameter budget and with only 5 000 training images, we set out to determine whether targeted architectural tweaks and regularization could deliver state-of-the-art performance on a modest dataset.
          We applied aggressive regularizationâ€”including L2 weight decay, random flips, crops, and color jitterâ€”alongside 4-fold cross-validation to reduce overfitting. To further enhance feature learning and gradient flow, we replaced hard-Swish with the smoother Mish activation and integrated a lightweight LR-ASPP decoder for multi-scale context aggregation. These changes were designed to maximize the modelâ€™s generalization ability and maintain real-time, on-device inference capability.
          Despite the limited training set, our enhanced MobileNetV3-Large achieved a mean F1 score of 0.875 and a mean IoU of 0.719, up from 0.745 and 0.590 respectively with the unmodified backbone. This demonstrates that, even with only 5 000 images and a sub-5 M-parameter footprint, MobileNetV3 can deliver high-precision, efficient facial segmentation when paired with thoughtful regularization and architectural improvements.
